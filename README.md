3D_projection
=============

Final project code for ENAS 130 Spring 2013 (Yale University, Marshall B. Long). Projects and rotates 3D objects.

Program intended to be run using Cygwin graphics capabilities. See graph_final for more details.

final_project.cpp is authored by me but needs the other 3 files, which contain function definitions, in the working directory in order to run. The other files were provided by professor Long.
